This is an open-source anti-virus which comes along with a bunch of tools which is useful for your day-to-day activity. This security toolkit is programmed in such a way that it will work with your primary anti-virus/anti-malware solution without making much performance hit.

Hit the first button in the antivirus-software and scan for the location. The engine will perform a scan which is based on priority scheduling i.e schedules the un-important files like .txt files in the back of the heap and will scan at-last while it gives priority for the important files and scans them first. You will find how many files are scheduled and how many files are currently processing in the anti-virus.
